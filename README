This was a quick hack to see if I could get it to work so I could import my wordpress blog posts into my website blog a while back.

Included is a windows 32 bit executable. This may compile on Linux, but I was just on a windows comp at the time.

I am now attempting to port this over to c++: https://github.com/jfrobbins/wordpress-xml-to-html-converter
